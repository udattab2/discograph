 -This software/tool provides an interface to the user
  for browsing through different audio artists and 
  discovering their work. Hence the name: Disco-Graph.
 -GUI could not be incorporated with this 
  application, however, it is very simple to use.

-----------------------------------------------------
		  How To Use:

-To run the application, open discograph.exe.
-A console window opens up displaying a few options.
-The First Display Console ('DISCOGRAPH') prompts you 
 to select the browsing mode/basis.
-To select an option on the screen, simply type in the
 character/number associated with the option and hit 
 RETURN.
-On each console display a similar methodology is used
 for browsing purposes.
-However, the searching is 'Case Sensitive', so make 
 sure maintaining proper case as you enter your search
 query.
-Enjoy using the application.

Thank You.
